# Hair-Flair

 Hair Flair is a responsive salon website to showcase salon services, features, and online booking functionality.It offers a user-friendly interface for clients to browse services, view customer feedback, and conveniently book appointments online.

**Technologies Used:**
"I built this project using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for interactivity. HTML allowed me to structure the content, CSS was used to style the website, and JavaScript was employed to enhance user experience and add some dynamic elements."

**Project Structure:**
"The project is organized into several sections: the banner, navigation, features, services, feedback, and footer. This structuring makes it easy for users to navigate and find the information they're interested in."

**Responsive Design:**
"I ensured the website is responsive by utilizing the viewport meta tag and responsive CSS techniques. This ensures that the website looks great and functions well on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices."

**Styling:**
"For styling, I used CSS to create an attractive and consistent visual experience. I integrated external CSS libraries for icons and fonts. The color scheme and font choices were carefully selected to align with the salon's branding."

**Interactivity:**
"To add interactivity, I implemented a JavaScript function that enables users to open and close the navigation menu. When the user clicks the menu icon, the navigation menu slides into view, enhancing the usability of the website."

**Features:**
"The website's features include:

A captivating banner showcasing the salon's logo, name, and a 'Book Now' call-to-action.
An easy-to-navigate menu that allows users to jump to different sections.
A 'Why Choose Us?' section highlighting the benefits of experienced stylists, online booking, and affordable pricing.
A 'Services' section showcasing the salon's offerings with images and descriptions.
A 'Client Feedback' area displaying testimonials to build trust and credibility.
A 'Contact' section in the footer providing opening hours, location, and contact information."

**Online Booking Form:**
"I also created a separate 'Book Appointment' page that features a form where users can submit appointment requests. The form uses Formspree to send emails to the salon's address, streamlining the booking process."
